But at some point it degenerates into another video game with explosions and bullets and absolutely no tension whatsoever. It felt like watching a demo reel for some 3D particle software. There are entire sequences that are entirely CGI and purposely look like CGI. so theres no sense of danger. Honestly. weve all seen CGI explosions and CGI car crashes and CGI machine guns... But when explosions dont break glass and cars bounce like rubber balls and bullets hit walls without leaving a mark... well. thats boring. Boring."}

Marvel Studios sunk $160 million into a 129 minute version of The Breakfast Club; Revenge of The Nerds and High School Musical all wrapped up into one. With a little bit of web slinging and Stark aircraft roaming the tulip fields around Netherlands. Watching Avengers movies you see the bigger intergalactic narrative from Thanos to the Kree to Nick Fury and his network of spies and enforcers. This movie is basically one comedy routine; one one-liner; one near miss to the next. Nothing spectacular besides visual effects and BeckMysterios illusions."}
