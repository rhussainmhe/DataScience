I am 62 bu was 13 or so when I started watching spidey and watched on and off right up to The latest Far From Home. A lot has changed. He is 16 years old come on now. He calls his aunt Mae.by her first name no respect there Peter. gotta say that I am not sure of that 16 years years old. He is fighting old dudes like me
3,2, It starts off really well. Theres humor and banter and interesting characterization.

But at some point it degenerates into another video game with explosions and bullets and absolutely no tension whatsoever. It felt like watching a demo reel for some 3D particle software. There are entire sequences that are entirely CGI and purposely look like CGI. so theres no sense of danger. Honestly. weve all seen CGI explosions and CGI car crashes and CGI machine guns... But when explosions dont break glass and cars bounce like rubber balls and bullets hit walls without leaving a mark... well. thats boring. Boring.

Im not concerned with the idea of Spider-man. you know. the comic book superhero & 16 year old kid. in what some more critical reviewers might feel is thier only angle of complaint. is in danger! Is there no significant Danger involved. with Mysterio and his illusion tech? Comprised of lethal drones firing concentrated projectile rounds. Wait a minute here. concentrated projectiles. not dangerous? What is this guy talking about. Who knows! I give it 55 stars for great storytelling.
7,3, As one of the few remaining people on the planet to finally see this movie for the first time; my impression is simple. OK movie.

Marvel Studios sunk $160 million into a 129 minute version of The Breakfast Club; Revenge of The Nerds and High School Musical all wrapped up into one. With a little bit of web slinging and Stark aircraft roaming the tulip fields around Netherlands. Watching Avengers movies you see the bigger intergalactic narrative from Thanos to the Kree to Nick Fury and his network of spies and enforcers. This movie is basically one comedy routine; one one-liner; one near miss to the next. Nothing spectacular besides visual effects and BeckMysterios illusions.
9,1, Given the amount of tough villains spider man fought previously this movie is terrible A guy who master of special effects and illusion thru machines fighting an avenger like spider man very lame! This movie is feeding off the success of endgame.

This movie is feeding off the success of endgame. Tobey maguires villains were excellent and good story. Terrible disappointment to say the least

I digress this movie was amazing and not just entertainment but a real glimpse at a real tech known as AR or Augmented Reality. If you think Spiderman wasnt a warning youre crazy. Were in a generation where people will believe ANYTHING they see. Remember believe half of what you see and none of what you hear!

Homecoming was a great reboot but Far From Home relies almost solely on comedy that works half the time. The action is serviceable but not unique or new. The characters are starting to get annoying. Peter Parker has had multiple films to grow a spine and believe in himself yet his character hasnt matured and is written to entertain teenagers. Sony is better off without the Marvel universe. the animated SpiderMan movie was much better.
15,3, Vanilla. but vanilla is the most popular ice cream. the usual MCU.

On the plus side. not twilight wolf level CGI on steroids like most of the MCU movies. when did SFX looking super fake become acceptable? Disappointed I bought this. Its a bit cheesy. a bit immature. and as family friendly as you can get while destroying cities. All for Sony continuing to break new ground with the Spider-Verse franchise which still takes the youth perspective but does something incredibly creative.
17,2, Meh.... Predictable. contrived and seemed like a stop gap. The premise was sound. but geez... I wanted to slap Peter so many times! There was way too much duh going on....if this was supposed to be a transomational moment for P. P.. I hope that hes not so dumb moving forward.
19,5, The story is a bit slow at first yes but the rest of the movie totally makes up for it.

The struggle Peter has on wanting to be a kid and enjoy his vacation but being pressured into being spiderman is greatly written and mysterios goals arent relatable but very much understandable as a manipulation of belief and him tackling Peters insecurities and fears play him out to be a very well done villain with a great preformance from Jake Gyllenhaal. 5 stars for me.
21,5, Plenty of great things in this film. Firstly. great casting. Also. were finally able to step away from the origin story loops of the Spidey flicks of the past.

Firstly. great casting. Also. were finally able to step away from the origin story loops of the Spidey flicks of the past. There are plenty of mind-bending visual effects which help add weight to Mysterios incredible illusions. Not sure how the next installment will develop Peter Parkers story. but this film definitely wasnt the forgettable mess that many sequels end up being.
23,5, this movie exceeded my expectations which were already at a high level. honestly I was surprised that my dad had managed to stay awake due to his late shifts at work but the movie kept him awake which is rare for a marvel movie. the only other one was captain America: civil war!
25,4, Do you notice that the older comments. when the movie first came out. are mostly 5 stars. but as time goes on you see a lot more 1 star reviews! whats that about?

Maybe the older posts are from people who went to the theater to watch. and the later ones are people who streamed it. or watched it via DVDBlu-ray..... still though. weird. But personally i liked the movie. even though they keep messing with the ethnics of MJ!
27,4, One of the best MCU sequels. The first act is a little slow. but its pretty funny. and picks up when Mysterio shows up. The villain isnt the traditional MCU bad guy.

The first act is a little slow. but its pretty funny. and picks up when Mysterio shows up. The villain isnt the traditional MCU bad guy. Hes petty and selfish. but hes also fun to watch because of Gyllenhaals performance (spoilers. but who cares). Spiderman was vastly improved. with more being responsibilities being pressed onto him as he tries to balance his life as Peter Parker with his life as a young superhero. Peter and MJ were adorable. too.
29,4, Guys dont get confused. This is Sony that has a contract with Marvel. thats why the movie is linked with MCU. They have one more movie left with them. then they split unless they renew.

This is Sony that has a contract with Marvel. thats why the movie is linked with MCU. They have one more movie left with them. then they split unless they renew. The movie was Ok. not excellent. It was funny. It became political in the end. but it is acceptable because they kind of have a point. The Philippino kid was very funny. I dont think Zendaya acts well. very one dimensional. They screwed up in the ending. Really Sony? Do billboardSscreens have audio?
31,1, Worst Marvel movie to date. I have always been a big superhero person and a big movie person and gosh damn this was horrible. There were so many inconsistencies throughout the movie. Make up was bad. There was also a scene that wasnt in sync with the audio. HIGHLY recommend to skip this one.
33,3, Just another stupid Marvel movie complete with a non-believable idiotic story filled with mind numbingly imbecilic dialog. So. two thumbs up if youre a die hard Marvie. Two thumbs WAY down if you have a brain and respect it.
35,3, I enjoyed this movie as i enjoy most marvel flicks. I really liked the story and arc they built for Mysterio as it wasnt your typical villain vs superhero battle. I get annoyed at points by our young hero being so naive but he redeems himself....id give it 3.5 if i could but i stuck with 3.
37,5, This movie absolutely gave me chills and the build up was exactly worth the wait. seeing this movie had the same energy as Homecoming but with deeper messages.

If you watch it. characters say things to help others and if you think about it. they are true things in our life. Tom Holland delivered well along with Zendaya in this movie! absolute chills! esspecially that one scene with Mysterio 👀

My wife who rarely ever is up long enough to enjoy action. Stayed up throughout the whole thing. It is funny. light entertainment. It is also a good take on Spiderman. Better in my opinion than Sonys lasts reboot sessions. The Good: Well paced. Funny. Good action and CGI. 🕷️ man is very likeable. Villain is very very well acted. The Bad: Villain doesnt have as compelling a reason as in Homecoming. VERDICT: buy a copy.

Peter Parker is known for how smart he is. but how can this idiot just give the most powerful tool in the world to a complete stranger. No spider sense and no brains. Just another bumbling idiot.

After the disaster of a movie in the spider verse movie this was a valid redemption. I just dont understand marvel ever allowing that garbage to be made. Dont hold the previous movie against the rest of these spiderman movies and enjoy them.
45,1, This is basically Iron Man Jr. Marvel seems incapable of making a Spiderman movie without Iron Mans story pushing the whole plot. Which by the way. this movie has a tremendously stupid plot. Spiderman is his own character. not Iron Mans sidekick.
47,5, Funny. very well written.

Those who see this film as capitalizing off the success of Endgame dont seem to realize that their are well written scenes that deal with loss and grief and multiple. very real emotions. This film addresses the ideas of trust. betrayal. loss. and gossip. There is so much in the film that noone talks about but are all integral to the story of spider-man. 5 stars is too little.
49,1, not that its a bad movie or anything but i rented it and started to watch it. but then i had to head to sleep and was working and in school and couldnt finish it. honestly abit peeved that i cant watch it within a 30 day span.... you should be able to watch it until you finish it....
51,1, I want to give this movie 1 and half stars but thats not an option and it doesnt deserve the second star in my opinion.

In my opinion heres what good and whats bad with me trying to keep it as spoiler free as possible. the good: Mysterio was Awesome All the scenes worth watching had him in them the action scenes in the second half of the movie were very fun to watch this is the Best version of MJ I have seen in a spiderman thus far Despite what i say below The bad The Character interactions are so forced its almost unwatchable. Feels more like they cobbled together 2 mini-movies of spiderman together just to make mysterios origin story to the point where i would rather it have been a mysterio movie not a spiderman movie. I Hate MJ as a love interest for peter. I like her character and the role she plays in peters life as the voice of reason to balance out peter vs spiderman. but i feel like she could do everything she does better as a friend not a love interest. and this shoves that down your throat. and finally it felt like spiderman was guest starring in this movie where peter parker and mysterio where the main characters. there were only a couple of scenes where i really felt like i was watching spiderman
53,5, ok movie and can use some work. if they hired sam raimi the movie wouldve been so much better. some parts were really cool but most of the movie was just useless information to me and probably the entire theater.

Even if you dont care about marvels universe or Spider-Man... you can enjoy this movie. Its not the special effects and action that I enjoyed. Its more of the secret message this movie brings which can be applied to our real world. I feel this movie is trying to tell the world something. If you want to find out what that message is. Look at the elementals. What could that represent in our real world? Then look at mysterio. Who are they in the real world

The rest of the story leading up to the great scenes. and after. are entertaining but not great. The elementals definitely feel like a Percy Jackson level of villains. which isnt saying much. But theyre not the point of the story or the main focus. A must see.
59,3, Disappointed with this one. Kind of jumbled and scattershot. Handing the glasses over to Mysterio seemed ridiculous and unbelievable. And the humor wasnt as sharp as the first movie - which was a big part of what made it so great.
61,1, This is the absolute worst thing a person can do to someone. Make there life a game. It destroyed me
63,3, Ugh. I hate the forced diversity in my movies so much. its ruining everything. MJ is no longer a redhead. the class has a muslim. Indian. blah. blah. Im surprised the muslim isnt the villan.
65,5, This movie was terrific it gave me everything I needed even the Peter tingles! Lol of course following and game there were some minor and major plot holes but its a superhero movie this is a universe for time travel as possible and there are superheroes. Cant wait for phase 4!

It was very creative. funny. and family-friendly. It also stayed true to comics as far as the character SpidermanPeter Parker. Although. it was a great movie I felt that it was directed for a less mature audience at times. And it felt like I was watching a cheesy teenage. coming-of-age movie instead of a superhero movie. Albeit. that was the point of the movie. its just not what I expected. Overall. fantastic movie!
69,4, Decent movie but it felt a little lacking in depth. I loved the tributesconnections to the repercussions of Endgame. However. for a high school trip. it was completely unrealistic. One of the extra scenes at the end will have major repercussions later. It will be interesting to see what they do.

Misterio was amazing and is now my favorite villion because Jake Gyllinhal could not play it better! and i loved how they really foces on Peter trying to adjust to the world with out Tony. they did a great job with that. All in all it was a great movie and i would not change anything about it and in my opinion its a cinamatic masterpiece!
77,5, After watching Captain Marvel and Endgame I was worried that Endgame would be the last good MCU flick. This movie reinstated my trust. Captain Marvel was so awful but Far From Home made up for it. Does a good job of keeping us on the MCU and Holland plays a great Parker. Fury is always a treat too.
79,3, I will premise to state my Spiderman preference is not Tom Holland. However. I was hopeful this movie would show a smarter side of Spiderman character. it did not give this unfortunately.

81,3, I like this spiderman better than Homecoming but what i dont like about this one is too much illusion and the ending is worse than homecoming ending. Also ends exactly how homecoming did WHAT THE FU-! But really if peter wish to reveal himself like Tony i expect to be better... disappointed...

85,5, For me. its the defining Spider-Man movie. I was raised on Toby Maguire as Spidey. but this movie was such a perfect story. You truly do see Peter grow. yes its more toward the end. but he truly changes a lot in this film. Loved it. Cant wait to watch it all the time now that its on Digital
87,3, definitely not the best spiderman movie. in my opinion they stray to far from what spideys core character truly is. the action is good the story is mundane especially is your a real spiderman fan. and know these characters you will know exactly where this movie is going and what the twist is. this i...Full Reviewdefinitely not the best spiderman movie. in my opinion they stray to far from what spideys core character truly is. the action is good the story is mundane especially is your a real spiderman fan. and know these characters you will know exactly where this movie is going and what the twist is. this is just another copy and paste mcu film and it works but its nothing new

In terms of the story. its just Spider-Man being dumb and being betrayed by an adult. But they execute the story pretty well. I like how they expand the story from being simple to being complex and they end it in a simple way. Im looking forward to next Spider-Man movie.
91,1, Disneys behavior after the movie made billions of dollars made me turn my head in disgust. The movie was fine until the end of the movie. The absolutely unbelievable level of greed coming from Disney should be illegal.
93,1, Bizarre. overly childish. immature. and dumb Peter story. What the heck is this ridiculousnes. Got better when focused on the bigger story and action.
95,5, I actually liked this Spider-man a lot better than Homecoming. And I loved Homecoming. The villain was more layered. and not feeling like some rip off from the second Amazing Spiderman. Oh look the villain is the your dates dad.. This is way better than that and lives up to Mysterio completely!

101,2, Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) was great. everything else not so much. It would be great if you could enjoy a movie now a day without the left smashing their politics in your face every 5 seconds in every single movie. heaven forbid they should value creativity over their political game for once....
103,1, How do you make a movie so bad that it should win the Raspberry awards? Cringey story. stupefying the character of Spiderman. make Mary Jane Watson a black chick despite the fact that shes ginger and white in the comics. and a crappy ending.
105,4, I couldnt watch the movie but l loved the trailer By candycane migit To people that hate me in my neighbor hood yeah that what you get miss fat ding dong bell yeah l hate you so much
107,3, The constant love affair between Peter and edgy girl (looks like a dude tbh) drove me to insanity. I kept hoping for some originality but the overall plot line is the same as every other Spiderman movie. 3 stars

Mysterio is just someone that got screwed over by Stark and doesnt actually have any connection with peter.peter literally just got back from the dead and all of a sudden he wants to be on vacation and start dating. the suits.all of his suits are either Stark technology or shield combat suits.the movie tries to tell us that peter should be himself.and then rhey play iron man music.it sucks.
113,4, This film was a very overrated. I think this was a casual marvel film. Mysterio was so disappointing in my opinion and was not true to the marvel comics

117,5, Well done. It is a new version of the classic Spider-man story. It pulls from the classic comics as well as from the already established MCU materials. Poor Peter cant seem to catch any breaks. Do yourself a favor and take your own break to catch this movie.
119,3, Lots of fun to be had. Action is well shot although extremely computer generated. Lots of plot missteps imo. You have to forgive a lot of what they do to have the plot happen at all. It could have been written better so that it falls in line with the characters more. Still a fun ride.

But as a spiderman sequel to what was a pretty great Spidey film its suffered due to the fact that instead of feeling like a spiderman movie it left me feeling like it was more of a foot note to what was avengers endgame.
123,5, BEST MOVIE EVER! I wish I could give it 6 stars! I cried at some parts! It was the most beautiful movie ever. My favorite MCU Film out of them all! Totally recommend other people to watch it. trust me. you WONT regret it!👍👍👍👍👍👍
125,2, The worst SM yet... The Muslim woman (23 min +) got more attention then SM... At least introduce her or give her some destructive power! The Blip.... Seriously? Very silly... wait until WalMart throw this one in the $1 basket before you watch! Music was ok though. Hope this is going somewhere....

129,1, Should call this whiner-man. Thats all he did and when did mj change races. With lame ass changes like these maybe Disney should stop trying to get this from Sony or whoever and kick it out of marvel universel.
131,5, This movie was brilliant. a good spider-man story with just enough peter parker to go around. It did a great job at starting Peter and MJs love story with keeping it interesting with adding a new villain to the MCU.
133,4, Marvel made a mistake at the beginning of the movie when they went through all of the Avengers who died in Endgame cause Caption America DID NOT die in Endgame he went back in the past to be with Peggy Carter and came back as an old man but he didnt die.

As far as the movie is concerned they made it like they were focusing on the relationship between Peter Parker and MJ more then anything else including Spider-Mans foe Mystario so I think the movie itself was good not great.
135,5, Greatest Movie of all Time better than the first Peters story is another him growing up but they honstly have to stop doing iron man stuff to poor Peter he needs to have a movie without him being involved with the picture so thats my only downside but best movie by far get it haha
137,5, Great movie. People review it too harshly and the CGI argument is annoying.
139,5, Story was interesting and I liked the writing -  funnier than expected .  I really like the fact that Marvel is starting to understand that comic movies should be funny - its more enjoyable the last few years.  Its why they continue to crush DC.  Now that being said - theres room for all.
141,5, As someone who LOVED Spiderman Homecoming. I can tell you this movie is better. Much better action and its a lot more funny. I still think the Vulture is a better villain. And its not because Jake Gyllenhaal played mysterio terribly but its because vulture had a more personal connection to Peter. ...Full ReviewAs someone who LOVED Spiderman Homecoming. I can tell you this movie is better. Much better action and its a lot more funny. I still think the Vulture is a better villain. And its not because Jake Gyllenhaal played mysterio terribly but its because vulture had a more personal connection to Peter. But overall. I think this is one of the best MCU Films.
143,1, A really bad movie. Far from home is far from good! Stick with Avengers.
145,1, Marvel found a way to ruin one of Spider-Mans greatest foes which is truly disappointing. This film left me asking one question: Tony Stark willingly died for this? No one can get Spider-Man right.
147,4, Not as good as homecoming but has a very unique twist at the end. Very excited to see how Marvel is going to formulate this spiderman with his struggles and adventures. Altogether a pretty good movie. but in my opinion. its basically a set up for the next movie

151,4, Great 2nd film!! I like how Peter is growing up and learning but still being humble. It sure sucks when u lose ur mentor. Itll be a challenge for Peter and Spiderman but luckily he has a good cast of friends and backup!!
153,5, Better than multiple MCU movies that proceeded it. Was over the universe after End Game. this movie brought me back in to the fold...worth a watch. if you like this sort of thing.
155,5, This was the BEST Spiderman movie Ive ever seen. It was a constant roller coaster. It wasnt predictable and it will leave you in saying no fn way. Highly recommend this movie!
157,5, A really good movie to give a sequel for the infinity saga.The best for people who have followed marvel start to finish.the news that our web singing teenage hero was leaving us.we all got deppressed.then spidey came back.like a miracle.With iron man gone.Peter gets e.d.i.t.h(even dead im the hero)a...Full ReviewA really good movie to give a sequel for the infinity saga.The best for people who have followed marvel start to finish.the news that our web singing teenage hero was leaving us.we all got deppressed.then spidey came back.like a miracle.With iron man gone.Peter gets e.d.i.t.h(even dead im the hero)and gives it to mysterio.realizes he made a mistake.gets run over by a train.got lied.tricked.and decived.Peter goes through alot in this movie and it shows himself alot.Overall this movie is Great.
159,5, Amazing movie with spectacular performances from Tom and Zendaya who bring these characters to life on the big screen in the most refreshing and unique story telling weve seen. assuring any spidey fan. an enamored good time with your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man!
161,5, I enjoy watching this movie though the ending credits werent as good as the movie. It still good to watch all over again. but I i dislike the fact that I will have to wait until the year of 2021 to watch the new movie.
163,4, The movie was ok. It had good chi and the plot twist regarding mephisto was believable. I like how spiderman was barely able to beat him. The movie was good
165,5, Awesome movie. Its hard to watch knowing hell never meet the Avengers again.
167,4, Far From Home takes us on fun misadventures of Parker. and further misadventures. and is just a fun time. I dont know if I like Homecoming or this better. I think each is better then the other in their own right.
169,5, i have not eatched it yet if any one could tell me how for free cause i dont have any money until like a year. please tell me how. my chdren are dying to watch this and so am i.
171,5, I would definitely recommend this movie. I saw it in the movie theater with my best friend and we were crying by the end. It is SO perfect in every way. Please enjoy this movie it is definitely worth the price no matter what.
173,5, I thought Far From Home was just great. Jake Gyllenhaal as Quenten BeckMysterio was just awesome to watch on screen with his performance in this movie. Totally buying this when it releases on Bluray.
175,2, The two post credit scenes were excellent. the movie has consequences and lasting effects that feel real going forward. Overall the movie is two big meaty scenes loosely connected.
177,3, WARNING SPOILERSSSSSSSSSSSSSS also im a kid so sorry for the spelling mistakes its a great movie but i liked in the start i would have preferred it to stay in that script like maybe they still had to defeat all five elements and the guy was good or it was a close friend peter had but then lets say h...Full ReviewWARNING SPOILERSSSSSSSSSSSSSS also im a kid so sorry for the spelling mistakes its a great movie but i liked in the start i would have preferred it to stay in that script like maybe they still had to defeat all five elements and the guy was good or it was a close friend peter had but then lets say he said he had illultion powers but it was the drowns and the drowns was his anyway he betrays peter take edith and copies peters voice BUt edith goes to peters phone to make sure and textes him so YEah BUT GREAT MOVE
179,5, This movie is the best Spider-Man since Spider-Man 2! It was so entertaining with the action. the comedy. the all the plot twists! This movie is a great way to show what the MCU is capable of after Avengers: Endgame. I highly recommend that you see this movie as soon as you can!
181,1, Bad movie. plot is so boring and the relationship between MJ and Peter is boring as well i wish this movie wasnt as forgettable as it is. and marvel didnt need to make this movie. the should have ended it at endgame
183,5, This was great way to continue Spider-Man story arc. such a shame that the deal between Disney and Sony is over. Hopefully Sony can make a third film and it turns out well.
185,5, If you think 24.99$ is reasonnable price its not. I would never pay when i can stream on Netflix. Way overpriced f that.
187,5, Yo the ending clip is awesome that mysterio came out on the news and told everybody Peter parkers identity. some spoilers mysterio is a villain. happy likes may. Ned gets a girlfriend and brakes up at the end and now mj knows Peter is spiderman
189,3, Started strong. but the obvious plot twists and the lack luster action scenes made for an ok way to pass some time but nothing spectacular.
191,5, Marvel is still owning this space. Plenty of laughs and surprises you just do not see coming. Great chemistry between the actors. A fun ride.
193,4, Spider Man Far From Home was really good. I do wonder when were going to see the villain from the end credits scene from Homecoming again though.
195,3, Like a lot here have said. it starts really well but eventually takes on a lot of tropes that are basically dollar store Iron Man. Homecoming was much better. but if youre in the mood for lots of big dumb explosions this is fine.
197,5, Awesome movie. Got teary eye when spider man was emulating stark with happy. i see now why people are pissed about a deal not being made with marvel and sony. Spider man belongs with with marvel and feige.

203,1, I havent watched Captain Marvel. then this Spider-Man is the worst Marvel movie ever for me.
205,2, Disappointed after watching. I did feel excited at first but its obvious that more and more BUGs appeared and then I found this movie is terrible and horrible in logic.

I did feel excited at first but its obvious that more and more BUGs appeared and then I found this movie is terrible and horrible in logic. Mysterio is a good villain. Iron Man is an admirable hero. Spider-Man is an independent hero. Its boring and disgusting to connect two heroes through PP paying TS s debt. TS can never replace Uncle Ben and never be Peters daddy (Personally I also thought Ben is not Peters father. Its different after all.)
207,5, I loved this movie. Its just so sad they wont be able to make a third one
209,3, Mannn... It was ok. I like Tom Holland. not sure about the other characters. Didnt like the villains. Just wasnt good enough for me.
211,5, Cant wait for the thired. hopefully the sinister six will be in it or at least venom.
213,5, already love this move it was awesome. just throwing this out there I think the next movie should have Kraven in it and I want Jason Momoa to play him. thatd be sick
215,1, I didnt watch this but then it was trash the plot didnt even make sense Spidermans getting extremely cheesey they should of stopped after the amount of hate the first one got!
217,5, I like it because hes always saving people every singleand the most I dont like when he gets hot every single time he said if you but I know its just ate but its just so sad 😔😭
219,1, lousy sarcasm. lousy humor and bad CG effects. typical spider man movie. reminds me of a bad sit com.
221,5, Great movie! Dont call it bad because its not tovy maguire you old farts lol. Dont call the new pete dumb and unbleeiveable. he is 16 and his mentor who was like a father dies. chill.
223,5, Best film but obviously not the best . even better than its predecessor. Jake Gyllenhaal stole the show. for once i thought he was a better villian than the main hero. infact he shd have been the hero hahaa
225,1, Why are my 4k movies not playing in 4k? It looks like 720p. I have everything turned on in my phone settings and app settings.
227,2, This almost felt like Iron Man 3. Mmm. What a disappointment.

It not only blew my expectations away but it made me love super heros even more. spider man is now my favorite super hero! The actor that plays Peter Parker .Tom Holland. is also a amazing actor! If you want a new favorite movie. like super heros. and or want a new favorite actor this is the movie!
231,5, Freaking loved this movie! Just when i thought it was gonna be ok or eh they did exactly what i was hoping they would do except better than i could have imagined. Tom. jake and. samuel were all great.
233,5, just wow this was a big step up from homecoming I didnt watch any trailers and had no expectations for the movie cause I didnt like homecoming but holy this was the best spider man movie ever right next to spider verse
235,5, I can say that this is the most cringey and Tom Holland movie ever. Ive enjoyed the jokes they had and the action was interesting. Theres no way you can be so hard on Tom when it comes to Spiderman because Tom Holland delivered along with Zendaya.
237,5, dont let nostalgia cloud judgment this movie is by far better the previous 2 spider-man universe
239,3, Great the first viewing. but not a ton of replay value when theres a big twist that changes a films tone and outlook. Funny with good acting and some decent action. Worth watching at least once.
241,5, Spiderman: Far From home is an amazing movie that can entertain even people that dont like superhero movies. The story is well thought out. and the effects are amazing.
243,5, Spoiler Alert This movie is the perfect sequel to a spider Man film it brings out the best in peter and how hard he tries to be the next tony stark when he realizes that its time for him to step up and be the next peter
245,4, It waent the best movie but i still loved it. If was action packed. I love Tom Holland way better than the other spider people. I would tottaly reccomend this for ages 12 and up. It is a awesone movie but it could have been just a tiny bit better! 😊😚
247,5, cant wait!!!!!! Im like so hyped i may need medical attention lol!
249,5, this is the frist Spider-Man movie i saw in theaters that i wanted go get up out of my seat and swing around. i thought it was a great Spider-Man movie cant wait for somemore!
251,5, Fustrante porque no entiendo inglés sólo la bi . Y eso porque tenía ganas de ver esa película
253,5, one of the best spiderman movies by far. pre ordered right after seeing the movie in theaters
255,3, Watched this in the theater. Wasnt entertained. It seems the Spiderman franchise is riding the coattails of Ironman for ticket sales.
257,5, i always feel movies are missing something even this one i like the end tho when he is exposed am really hoping for a 3rd one
259,3, Nothing about this movie was super interesting or exciting. I feel like Ive seen this same movie 17 different times. It wasnt bad. it just wasnt good.
261,1, this quality sucked. but the movie was great i would reccondomen you to not buy it from here but instead just watvh it illega
263,5, I thought the preview of this movie with the Mysterio character looked pretty lame. But after watching it. its actually really good. I love it!
265,5, Best spider man movie ever😍 CGI Level: infinity just lit damn😍
267,5, In my opinion the best Spidey ever. i love what they did with characters and the plot of the movie is just very well structured. alot of imagination was given it. Tom Holland is just great in this movie. cant stop having enough of him.
269,5, Best spiderman movie I ever watched. Good job Marvel. Hope yall come to a new agreement with Sony
271,2, I accedently bought this on the wrong account and Google will not change it.
273,5, it was amazing my new favorite movie I dont really like marvel movies cause their just talking for like half of the movie but I loved it 5 stars
275,4, I absolutely detest the cringe humor in this movie. but at the same time this is hands down the best Mysterio story that will ever be put on the big screen and Im actually starting to get behind the chemistry between Peter and MJ.
277,5, Excellent movie normally dont care to spend money on a movie in the theaters twice but this one warranted two trips
279,5, Its a must have in your collections and well made spider man far from home will leave you with a feeling non other than spidey twinkles haha :) its a must watch guys and get the special edition from target (: 🕷🕸😁❤
281,5, Just Epic in everyway and the post cast scenes even make me want to have more 👌🏾
283,1, Movie stopped playing every 10mins and required us to hit retry
285,1, zendaya had an attitude like brie larson ... total shrimp loons
287,5, What can I say. if your a Spider-Man fan then just watch it. Great movie. Tom Holland is a great Peter Parker
289,5, Its funny and has an interesting plot and the post credit scene hints at a prequel which Im excited for. Great movie overall!
291,5, I love this movie I would watch it over and over again it has nice story good scenery and just awesome actors.
293,5, I saw this movie yesterday and I think the movie was awsome it was so awsome i wanna see it agian when it goes on dvd. Spider Man is my all time favorite superhero. If it goes on Netflix im watching it!
295,4, If you are one to do things like actually pay attention to the storyline while youre watching a movie. its quite good. Mysterio is one of my favorite characters and he is very well represented here. making for a quality superhero tale.
297,5, Yes. this has different flavors and textures then earlier movies. Not necessarily better or worse... Enjoy it. its fun and entertaining...
299,5, my favorite part was when mj found out peter was spider man the movie was awesome
301,5, Better than anticipated. Though i really wish they just drop the Ironman thing.
303,5, This movie was so good if was a competition between the old spider n the amazing spider man movies this one would beat all them
305,5, Is super maverlus. Action triller.how a loser can Save the world
307,5, (SPOILERS) one of the best spider-man movies i ever seen. i still like spider-man 2 more (with tobey maguire) but it was amazing. i loved the twist. it was amazing 1010
309,5, The plot twist after plot twist was blowing me away *spoiler* I cant belive all the illusions its crazy makes my heart race and ofcourse tom holland (best spiderman)
311,5, i havent watched it yet but i bet mysterio is secretly evil
313,1, Why is this listed as a NEW DVD RELEASE when it HAS NOT been released in DVD yet?  How can it be NEW DVD release if its NOT on DVD at all ?
315,5, I just saw the extended cut of this movie and its just amazing Id say probably one of the best Spider-Man ever and Tom Holland is the best Spider-Man
317,5, Es la película que jamás he visto en mi vida pero espero que la pongan en la televisión o la pongan otra vez en el cine
319,5, Tom Holland. Zendaya and the rest of the cast bring a refreshing take on the world of Spider-Man in this modern age. with respect to Stan Lees Marvel Cinematic Universe. This is the ONLY actor for the job now! 1010
321,5, Es emosionante sus efectos especiales muy parecidos a la realidad☺
323,5, i love how in the end it was so cool it was like boom boom boom and then rocks were falling down
325,5, Filme do homem-aranha muito top tem vários Ele conta a história do homem-aranha de vários caras que tem no filme é muito top opção acho que eu gostei mais foi do Mistério do homem-aranha e os elementos tipo a água o fogo esses elementos
327,5, The movie was really good and I enjoyed it very much the fight scenes were great and you definitely shouldnt watch it if you havent see Avengers:Endgame
329,5, E um filme muito bom pra quem gosta de açao de avemtura e um pouco de medo
331,5, I lived for this movie. it was funny. clever and had a good plot. They did it once again. Great movie!
333,5, im a HUGE spider Man fan please make more movies of spiderman
335,4, Better than the first movie for sure. Wont disappoint
337,5, Everything about this was exceptional. The way they did Mysterio fit perfectly. Probably the best Spider-Man movie yet.
339,2, I pre-ordered it and uh. Now its telling my to buy it
341,5, Straight beautiful. amazing lovely counter for what Endgame did to everyone (5 Stars) in my book! :)
343,1, We dont want this kid as spidey. I want legendary Tobey maguire in spider custom again
345,5, What fat rat bastard thought it was a good idea to.....Dang! Now we cant wait for the next movie! Funny. funny. funny stuFF! althroughout the movie. Loved it. Mean it. SEE it.
347,5, A worthy conclusion to the Infinity Saga with a great cast. visuals and story. Seen it on the fourth of July and is a definite watch!
349,5, Best Spider-Man film and MCU to date!
351,5, Amazing movie! Only thing is I guessed who the villan was pretty much right away.
353,1, AGAIN.... Its feels more of a prequel trilogy.
355,5, A light-hearted close to a darker chapter of the MCU. Excellent watch. cannot wait to see it again!
357,1, For one he does not have suit iron man gave him. then u add a super hero no one knows
359,2, Tom is without a doubt the worse spiderman character ever..very disappointed.
361,5, Hes back once more and I dont just mean after coming back from the snap in Infinity War hopefully Sony and Disney can work out this new deal for Peters adventures in this franchise to continue
363,5, This film is a free in( سينمانا).You can watch that
365,1, Can I have this movie can I watch it right now
367,3, Güzel ama 2 puanı süre an kırdım bi ergen ama özel yeteneği sadece kosþüm giyince olu ya ben saçma buldum
369,5, Its very well and entertaining movie i never see i love Marvel history 5 🌟 for this great movie
371,5, The BEST MCUSpider-Man Movie EVER!!!! Tom Holland Is PERFECT As Spider-Man & Jake Gyllenhaal did a FANTASTIC Job as Mysterio!! NO ONE could remake this LEGENDARY MASTERPIECE!!!! 💯💯💯💯
373,5, Best Cinematic Spidey Movie Ever!!! Way better than Homecoming
375,5, I LOVE THIS MOVIE! There were so many good scenes that gave me goosebumps.
377,5, Was a solid build on the first Spiderman and Endgame! Love the expectations and depth on Spiderman! Loved the love intrigue with Peter and MJ! Loved the villain! It was another fresh perspective on the best Superhero around!
379,5, enjoyed this one far better than homecoming ever was
381,5, فیلمی بسیار عالی و جذاب دانلود کنید
383,5, Its only a best movie in the earth . Spider man likes me
385,4, eu nem sei em inglês mais parece que o filme é muito bom. mais eu nem assisti porque eu no sou dos Estados Unidos
387,5, Tom Holland. Zendaya.Jacob Batalon and the rest of the cast 1010 job!!
389,5, This movie is awesome and you NEED to watch it. I think it’s a really good movie but it’s ok if you don’t like it
391,5, Absolutely love this movie. I love Spider-man Ive watched every single Spider-man movie and this one exceeded all my expectations with phenomenal heights. 1010 would watch 100 more times. Thank you.
393,5, Great use of a broad variety of the Web Slingers skills!
395,1, Spider man far from home is rated pg 13
397,5, great movie hated the spoilers for endgame at the start thow
399,4, really good. i love the fact that both marvel spiderman movies end with the line  oh what the fu..... hahahahaha
401,5, Greatest interpretation of Spiderman. Just enough Peter Parker and Spiderman combo and had a good story and a well written script.
403,4, A good continuation of the story. If you liked the first one. you will like this one.
405,5, i thought it was gonna be bad . but turns ITS THE BEST MOVIE EVER
407,5, Some of the best Spidy action sequences ever in a movie. The story could be a bit meh at times but I was hoping to be entertained by my favorite web slinger and I wasnt disappointed.
409,1, this movie came out a month ago
411,5, One of the better Spider man movies that are out. This time line is actually good. Glad they kept it this way. Cant wait to see how Phase 4 of the MCU is going to be after this
413,5, fantastic movie and it exceeded my expectations by a mile. I love everything about this movie and cant wait to watch it over again
415,5, Awesome Spider man move. Loved it! I hope they keep this Peter Parker. Please do Marvel Studios.
417,5, Loved it even though personally I feel that Spiderman story has been played out.
419,5, Great Movie. Great Writing. Sucks that Spidey Isnt part of the MCU anynore
421,2, Giving a two stars because theres no rent option
423,2, Meh. Wasnt worth the purchase. Marvel has kind of lost its charm for me. Its pretty much an interchangeable superhero movie with the same ol same ol. If thats what youre lookig for. great. But not a lot of substance to this one.
425,5, awesome movie definitely watch it twice and epic twist at the end
427,5, its freaking good. Tom Holland is good. Zendaya is good. Sam L Jackson is good. Jake Gylenhaal is good. its just good.
429,5, My new favorite MCU movie.Tom Holland is by far the best spider-man
431,5, This was an awesome and fun movie! p.s. I totally didnt see it coming
433,5, Amazing Movie ever in Spider-Man series

445,5, hola hola hola hola Luis Fonsi Sí ma Gracias por la película brother esa película
447,5, Without being biased. This is by far the Best Spider-Man movie to date. Complete capture of the character in todays timeline. 👍👍👍
449,5, I love spider man and Ive wanted to see this for a while so I think spider man far from home is a 5 star movie
451,5, what an amazing experience! it is a truly exiting film. my favorite Spider-man EVER this is better than Spider-man Homecoming
453,5, Самое крутое кино. Я ево люблю смотреть с ПАПОЙ.
455,3, Its ok. definitely not better than the Spider-man Home Coming movie...
457,5, it is asome and i like the part that they do the halagram an the lava manster
459,3, I was good but it was boring at the same time
461,5, Wtqgfqgdkjdhdhdjshshsjgs sjgy you so much for your help and t for you so
463,4, Forgot to rate it. It was good. but I wouldve liked if they spent time in london before they had the final battle.
465,4, miss to iron man 😢 nice move
